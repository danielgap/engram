# Engram Doctor

`engram doctor` runs read-only operational diagnostics against the local SQLite store. It detects, explains, and suggests safe next steps; the base diagnostic command does **not** repair data, apply migrations, delete rows, or mutate sync cursors.

## CLI

```bash
engram doctor
engram doctor --json
engram doctor --project engram
engram doctor --check sync_mutation_required_fields
engram doctor repair --project sias-app --check session_project_directory_mismatch --plan
engram doctor repair --project sias-app --check session_project_directory_mismatch --dry-run
engram doctor repair --project sias-app --check session_project_directory_mismatch --apply
engram doctor acknowledge --check orphaned_observation_session --project engram --note "accepted by ops"
engram doctor acknowledge --check orphaned_observation_session --revoke
engram doctor acknowledge --check orphaned_observation_session --revoke --fingerprint <hex>
```

Flags:

- `--json` prints the stable diagnostic envelope for agents.
- `--project PROJECT` scopes checks to a normalized project name.
- `--check CODE` runs one registered check and fails loudly for unknown codes.
- `doctor repair` supports exactly `invalid_session_identity`, `manual_session_name_project_mismatch`, `orphaned_observation_session`, `session_project_directory_mismatch`, `sync_mutation_required_fields`, and `sync_target_closed_space`. It requires `--project`, `--check`, and exactly one mode: `--plan`, `--dry-run`, or `--apply`. `sync_mutation_required_fields` may omit `--project` and the mode; an omitted mode defaults to `--dry-run`. Its optional project scopes title repair, supersession, quarantine, and source-title repair. The diagnostic-only checks are `ambiguous_active_runtime_sessions`, `sqlite_lock_contention`, and `unowned_session_project`; a rejected repair names the corresponding `engram doctor --check <code>` continuation.

## Acknowledgements

`engram doctor acknowledge` persists a human acceptance of individual doctor findings, so a finding a human has reviewed and accepted stops re-reporting on every run without anyone editing the underlying data.

```bash
# Acknowledge every finding a check currently reports for one project:
engram doctor acknowledge --check orphaned_observation_session --project engram --note "accepted by ops"

# Revoke one acknowledgement by fingerprint, or all acknowledgements of a check:
engram doctor acknowledge --check orphaned_observation_session --revoke --fingerprint <hex>
engram doctor acknowledge --check orphaned_observation_session --revoke
```

Semantics:

- Each acknowledgement is stored locally in `doctor_acknowledgements`, keyed by the check code and the sha256 fingerprint of the finding's evidence (the full 64-character hex; CLI output truncates to the first 12 characters for display). Identical evidence keeps its acknowledgement across runs; any change to the evidence value is a new, unacknowledged finding. `--note` records the acceptance rationale.
- The command runs the requested check scoped by `--project`, acknowledges exactly the findings that run reports, and prints one line per acknowledged finding plus a total. When the check reports nothing, nothing is acknowledged and the command exits 0. `--json` prints a stable envelope (`mode`, `count`, `acknowledged` entries, or `fingerprint` for revocations). There are no interactive prompts; everything is explicit flags.
- Report filtering: acknowledged findings are removed from `engram doctor` output. Active findings alone drive a check's severity and the report status; a check whose findings are all acknowledged reports `ok` with `acknowledged_count` set, and a mixed check keeps its active severity with `acknowledged_count` reporting the rest. Both fields are omitted when empty so unaffected reports keep their shape.
- Self-prune rule: a full unscoped `engram doctor` run proves which acknowledgements still match live evidence, so it deletes rows whose evidence no longer exists and reports the total as `acknowledgements_pruned` (text line `acknowledged (N pruned)`). Single-check runs and `engram doctor acknowledge` never prune: a scoped run does not prove the absence of evidence other scopes would still find.
- Allowlist: acknowledging is restricted to `AcknowledgeableCodes()` — currently `orphaned_observation_session` and `ambiguous_active_runtime_sessions`. It exists for diagnostic-only findings a human has accepted. Repairable checks stay out of it deliberately: their honest exit is the repair itself, not a persisted silence, so an acknowledged row can never stand in for work the repair path exists to do.
- Revocation is explicit: `--revoke` without `--fingerprint` removes every acknowledgement for the check and prints the count; with `--fingerprint` it removes that single row. Acknowledgements are local operator state: they journal no sync mutations, never alter findings or observations, and are not replicated.

## MCP

Agents can call `mem_doctor` with the same contract as `engram doctor --json`:

```json
{
  "project": "engram",
  "check": "sqlite_lock_contention"
}
```

Both fields are optional. When `project` is omitted, MCP uses the existing read-tool project detection. Unknown explicit projects return the standard structured `unknown_project` error.

## JSON envelope

The CLI `--json` and MCP tool return:

```json
{
  "status": "ok|warning|blocked|error",
  "project": "engram",
  "summary": { "total": 4, "ok": 4, "warnings": 0, "blocked": 0, "errors": 0 },
  "checks": [
    {
      "check_id": "sqlite_lock_contention",
      "result": "ok|warning|blocked|error",
      "severity": "info|warning|blocking|error",
      "reason_code": "stable_reason_code",
      "evidence": {},
      "safe_next_step": "No action required.",
      "requires_confirmation": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## MVP check catalog

- `session_project_directory_mismatch` — warns when `sessions.project` disagrees with the project inferred from trusted repository evidence for the session directory. A known exact `manual-save-{project}` target takes precedence over directory inference, so it does not produce this competing finding. Unknown manual suffixes and non-manual sessions retain normal trusted-directory behavior. The MVP trusts `git_remote` and `git_root` only; it ignores basename fallback, ambiguous workspaces, missing directories, and child-repo auto-promotion to avoid noisy false positives.
- `manual_session_name_project_mismatch` — warns when a known `manual-save-{suffix}` session name disagrees with its persisted project. The suffix must normalize to a project already evidenced by a local session; a name alone never establishes `project_owned` ownership.
- `ambiguous_active_runtime_sessions` — warns once per project when two or more active runtime candidates match the same directory. Evidence contains the active-candidate count, involved directories, and session IDs. It uses the same lease-aware selection as omitted-session resolution: valid unexpired local leases take precedence in their own directory, expired or malformed nonblank leases are excluded, and the legacy seven-day effective-activity window applies only when that directory has no live lease. Multiple live leases remain ambiguous. Doctor is diagnostic-only: it never selects, ends, or modifies sessions. End only confirmed stale IDs with `mem_session_end`; otherwise keep explicit runtime attribution with `session_id` on writes.
- `sync_mutation_required_fields` — blocks when a pending `sync_mutations.payload` is missing required fields. On a device that uses cloud sync (at least one project enrolled), it also blocks when pending cloud mutations belong to a project that is not enrolled; the finding identifies the project and backlog count, so enroll intended projects with `engram cloud enroll <project>` or review enrollment before retrying. A local-only install with no enrolled project never reports that finding: any pending non-enrolled row there is legacy or otherwise pre-existing backlog, because new unenrolled local writes are not journaled.
- `orphaned_observation_session` — warns when active or soft-deleted observations reference a missing session. Findings are grouped by the stored observation project and session ID. The original session cannot be recovered, but `engram doctor repair --check orphaned_observation_session --project <project> --plan|--dry-run|--apply` can rebuild a placeholder parent session locally; groups whose session ID carries a delete tombstone are skipped (`session_delete_tombstoned`) instead of being rebuilt.
- `unowned_session_project` — warns for each session with an unclassified or invalid ownership mode, including blank persisted projects and contradictory legacy manual-save identities. Doctor never guesses a rescue. Use `engram projects rescue-ownership --project <name> --session <id>` only after review; its apply path creates a SQLite backup that can be restored for rollback. The listing is deliberately unscoped.
- Session modes are `shared` and `project_owned`. Runtime and HTTP-created sessions default to `shared`; deterministic CLI and MCP manual-save sessions are `project_owned`. Shared sync can use old peers. Project-owned sync requires a mode-capable manifest (version 2); returning to an older manifest after project-owned sessions exist is unsupported and fails loudly.
- `sqlite_lock_contention` — warns on conservative SQLite contention signals; returns an error if lock state cannot be evaluated.

## Safety

Plain `engram doctor` remains diagnostic-only. Findings that imply data movement set `requires_confirmation=true` so agents know a human must review evidence before repair.

`engram doctor repair` is intentionally narrow and local-first: local SQLite remains the source of truth. Project reclassification supports:

- `session_project_directory_mismatch`, using trusted `git_remote` or `git_root` evidence from doctor findings.
- `manual_session_name_project_mismatch`, only for exact `manual-save-{known_project}` sessions. The known manual target takes precedence over trusted directory evidence; unknown suffixes remain unrepaired.

Title restoration supports `sync_mutation_required_fields` only when a pending observation upsert has a blank title as its sole missing field and the matching local titleless observation has non-empty content. Run `engram doctor repair --check sync_mutation_required_fields --dry-run` first (add `--project <project>` to scope it); cloud-upgrade tooling instead requires configured cloud sync. The repair derives a sanitized, bounded title from local content and updates `observations.title` and `sync_mutations.payload` in place; all other invalid mutations remain quarantined on `--apply`.

The same repair also supersedes a pending local upsert when a local session/observation delete tombstone or prompt tombstone proves the entity was deleted while its project was unenrolled. `superseded` is auditable local evidence, not a cloud acknowledgement: it is excluded from transport and allows re-enrollment backfill to reconstruct the current local delete state. Superseded evidence missing its reason, evidence, or timestamp remains blocking until manually repaired; complete terminal quarantined and superseded rows remain informational without keeping doctor in warning or blocked status.

Repair never deletes or deduplicates rows, never edits sync cursors, never acknowledges undelivered mutations, and never writes cloud state. `--plan` and `--dry-run` are non-mutating. `--apply` creates a SQLite backup under `<ENGRAM_DATA_DIR>/backups/` before a project reclassification transaction updates only:

- `sessions.project`
- `sessions.ownership_mode` (`project_owned` for a session named `manual-save-{target_project}`, otherwise `shared`)
- `observations.project`
- `user_prompts.project`

Title restoration does not create a SQLite backup.

The orphaned-session repair supports `orphaned_observation_session`: on `--apply` it creates a SQLite backup and then inserts one placeholder parent session per orphan group, with `directory=''`, `started_at` set to the group's earliest observation timestamp (soft-deleted observations included), `ended_at` set to the same value so the rebuilt session is terminal and can never be selected as an active runtime session, `ownership_mode` set to `project_owned` only for a `manual-save-{project}` ID (otherwise `shared`), and a `placeholder rebuilt by doctor repair (orphaned_observation_session)` summary marking the row as rebuilt. Sessions whose ID holds an active delete tombstone are skipped — in the plan and again defensively inside the apply transaction — because rebuilding them would resurrect deliberately deleted data. The repair is local-only: it enqueues no sync mutations and touches no sync cursor. Re-running after a successful apply reports `noop`.

`ambiguous_active_runtime_sessions`, `sqlite_lock_contention`, and `unowned_session_project` are diagnostic-only and are not supported by `engram doctor repair`. SQLite lock contention has no repair.

### Repair JSON envelope

All repair modes print stable JSON to stdout:

For `sync_mutation_required_fields`, `repairs` lists title-only observation upserts that can be restored in place; `actions` continues to list residual rows quarantined on `--apply`; `superseded` lists obsolete local upserts retired by durable local delete evidence. For `orphaned_observation_session`, `session_rebuilds` lists the placeholder sessions `--apply` inserts (one per orphan group, with the group's `started_at` and `observation_count`), and `skipped` lists tombstoned session IDs the repair refuses to rebuild.

```json
{
  "project": "sias-app",
  "check": "session_project_directory_mismatch",
  "mode": "plan|dry_run|apply",
  "status": "planned|dry_run|applied|noop",
  "actions": [
    {
      "session_id": "session-id",
      "from_project": "sias-app",
      "to_project": "engram",
      "reason_code": "session_project_directory_mismatch",
      "evidence_source": "git_remote"
    }
  ],
  "skipped": [],
  "counts": {
    "sessions_planned": 1,
    "observations_planned": 2,
    "prompts_planned": 1,
    "sessions_applied": 0,
    "observations_applied": 0,
    "prompts_applied": 0
  },
  "backup_path": ""
}
```

On `--apply`, `backup_path` contains the backup database path and `*_applied` counts report the rows updated.

### Clone-safe verification workflow

Never experiment on production `~/.engram/engram.db`. Use a SQLite backup clone or a temporary `ENGRAM_DATA_DIR`:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/engram-repair-clone
sqlite3 ~/.engram/engram.db ".backup '/tmp/engram-repair-clone/engram.db'"
ENGRAM_DATA_DIR=/tmp/engram-repair-clone engram doctor --json --project sias-app --check session_project_directory_mismatch
ENGRAM_DATA_DIR=/tmp/engram-repair-clone engram doctor repair --project sias-app --check session_project_directory_mismatch --plan
ENGRAM_DATA_DIR=/tmp/engram-repair-clone engram doctor repair --project sias-app --check session_project_directory_mismatch --dry-run
ENGRAM_DATA_DIR=/tmp/engram-repair-clone engram doctor repair --project sias-app --check session_project_directory_mismatch --apply
```

After a project reclassification apply, verify each planned session's `project` and `ownership_mode` classification, the related observation and prompt projects, and that `backup_path` exists. If the repair is wrong, stop Engram processes and restore the `backup_path` database file manually.
